## Project Title

**Netflix Movies and TV shows till 2025**

---

## Project Objective

This dataset contains information on Netflix movies and TV shows, sourced from TMDb (The Movie Database). It includes titles, genres, release dates, ratings, descriptions, and other relevant metadata. The dataset has been curated to provide a comprehensive overview of Netflix's content library, making it useful for data analysis, recommendation systems, and trend exploration.

## Abstract

Managing and analyzing content data is essential for understanding viewer preferences and content trends in the fast-growing world of online streaming. This project presents a Python-based approach to organizing and analyzing Netflix’s movie and TV show catalog using data sourced from TMDb (The Movie Database) and Kaggle.

The system collects detailed information, including titles, genres, release dates, ratings, and content descriptions. The data is cleaned, formatted, and stored in a structured database for smooth querying and trend analysis. The backend uses Python to connect to TMDb's API and retrieve the latest content details, ensuring the dataset remains current and relevant.

Key features of the system include genre-based categorization, rating distribution tracking, and content release timeline analysis. This dataset and system can be used to build recommendation engines, explore content trends over time, and support content-based marketing strategies.

By combining historical and live content data, this project delivers a strong base for deep insights into Netflix’s evolving media library and enhances the potential for personalized recommendations and media analytics.

## Introduction

This project aims to conduct a detailed analysis of Netflix's content library, focusing on historical and current data related to movies and TV shows. It explores patterns in content genres, release trends, viewer ratings, and other metadata to understand how Netflix's catalog has evolved. The main objective is to uncover insights about content popularity, genre distribution, and viewer engagement that can support data-driven decisions and recommendations. The project uses a cleaned and processed dataset from Kaggle, integrates real-time updates from the TMDb API, and builds visualizations and models to highlight key trends.
